                            Monitoring System for MOVs (Means of Verification) of Action Plans is a powerful tool designed to enable executives and key stakeholders to track, evaluate, and make informed, data-driven decisions based on real-time submissions of supporting documents. This system enhances organizational oversight by providing a centralized platform for managing and verifying the progress of action plans, ensuring that initiatives are executed efficiently and in alignment with strategic goals.

                            By automating tracking, reporting, and compliance monitoring, the system streamlines the entire action plan management process, reducing manual workload and minimizing the risk of oversight or delays. Executives can easily monitor the status of required MOVs, identify gaps in implementation, and take proactive measures to address potential issues. The system also promotes transparency and accountability, ensuring that all stakeholders are aligned with organizational objectives and compliance requirements.

                            This system was built through the initiative of the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples-Regional Office 1 (NCIP RO1), spearheaded by the ICT team, namely Jomar D. Aliba (ICT Focal) and Pamela Patacsil (Alternate ICT Focal). It was developed under the guidance of the Office on Policy, Planning, and Research Bureau, represented by Atty. Harriet N. Abyadang, with the full support of OIC Regional Director of NCIP RO1, Atty. Marvin C. Biligan.
